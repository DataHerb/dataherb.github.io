DataHerb is built to make clean and documented small datasets easy to retrieve. DataHerb is the missing open data listing service for datasets.

> For Mac users, DataHerb is your "[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for data".

## How Does It Work?

DataHerb do **not** take your data. The datasets are fully managed by the owners or curators. Once the dataset is linked to DataHerb, we will aggregate the metadata and build a page for the dataset.

## Roadmap

- Pandas Package: load and explore any dataset together with the documentation using one line of python code.
- Command-line tool: load and explore any dataset together with the documentation in your terminal.
- Versioned datasets: make use of GitHub tag/release to version datasets and index versioned datasets automatically.
- **Your ideas**
